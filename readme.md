## Introduction
This is a side project I've been working on. A full stack invoicing application made using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React & Nodejs), specially designed for freelancers and small businesses, but can be used for almost any type of business need. With this application, you can send beautiful invoices, receipts, estimates, quotes, bills etc to your clients. Jump right off the [Live App](https://invoice.alokjha.live/) and start sending invoice or download the entire [Source code](https://github.com/codrAlxx/invoice-webapp) and run it on your server. This project is something I've been working on in my free time so I cannot be sure that everything will work out correctly. But I'll appreciate you if can report any issue.


## Key Features
- Send invoices, receipts, estimates, quotations and bills via email
- Generate and send/download pdf invoices, receipts, estimates, quotations and bills via email
- Token based authentication with reuse detection and refresh token rotation and Social Authentication with Google
- Email sending with Mailhog for development and Mailgun for production
- Multiple user registration alongside Modern Redux with ReduxToolkit and ReduxToolkit Query
- Payment history section for each invoice with record about payment date, payment method and extra note.
- Clean admin dashboard for displaying all invoice statistics including total amount received, total pending, recent payments, total invoice paid, total unpaid and partially paid invoices. 
- Custom Logging in NodeJS with Morgan & Winston and utilized Cloudinary for Image upload
- Setup NGINX proxy manager and used Portainer to manage containers in a production environment within a Docker Container
- Served a MERN web app securely using HTTPS and SSL on DigitalOcean Servelet

## Configuration and Setup

### Local Setup
![Docker](https://res.cloudinary.com/dsw2tkyc8/image/upload/v1689116664/docker_rptcyn.png)
In order to run this project locally, simply fork and clone the repository or download as zip and unzip on your machine. 
- Open the project in your prefered code editor.
- Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code)
- create a .env file in the root of your directory.
- Supply the following credentials

```
PORT=1997 
NODE_ENV=development
DB_NAME= DATABASE NAME
SENDER_EMAIL= YOUR SUPPORT EMAIL
DOMAIN =http://localhost:8080

JWT_ACCESS_SECRET_KEY=YOUR SECRET ACCESS
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET_KEY=YOUR REFRESH TOKEN SECRET

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=auth/google/redirect

MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME=
MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=


CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY= 
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```


#### Google Auth
To get your Google ClientID for authentication, go to the [credential Page ](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (if you are new, then [create a new project first](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) and follow the following steps;

- Click Create credentials > OAuth client ID.
- Select the Web application type.
- Name your OAuth client and click Create
- Remember to provide your domain and redirect URL so that Google identifies the origin domain to which it can display the consent screen.
- In development, that is going to be `http://localhost:8080` and `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/google/redirect`
- Copy the Client ID and assign it to the variable `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and client secret `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in your .env file

#### MongoDB
We are going to be using Mongo Express in production. is an interactive lightweight Web-Based Administrative Tool to effectively manage MongoDB Databases.
- The databse is running on port `8081`.
- We need to Provide credentials for the root user `MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME` and `MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD` in .env file which will be used as `ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME` and  `ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD` yml file.
- For logging in as user the default Username `ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_USERNAME` is `admin` and password `ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD` is `admin123456`.
- You can change the basic user credentials in local.yml file of the root directory.

#### Cloudinary
To get your Cloudinary and cloud name `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` and credentials for it go to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and register for a free account. For further information on how to get your API keys go to the [credential Page ](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/cloudinary_credentials_tutorial). You can further use AWS S3 Bucket or any other service as per your choice.

#### Mailhog
To Test emails in a local development environment i have utilized mailhog. To see all the mails go to port 8025 on localhost.

### DOCKER
Using docker is simple. Just use the following MAKE commands.
After setting up all your envoirnment variables and credentials. To spin up all the containers you can use the make commands or manually type your command in the terminal. The following commands have been added.


- - - -
_To Build all the containers and remove containers which were created in a previous run :_
```javascript
   make build
```
- - - -
_To start and run the entire app:_
```javascript
   make up
```
- - - -
_To stop all the containers and remove them:_
```javascript
   make down
```
- - - -
_To show logs of all the containers:_
```javascript
   make show-logs
```
- - - -
_To show logs of all the client side:_

## Production Setup
In order to run this project locally, simply fork and clone the repository or download as zip and unzip on your machine. 
- Open the project in your prefered code editor.
- Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code)
- Split your terminal into two (run the client on one terminal and the server on the other terminal)

In the first terminal
- cd client and create a .env file in the root of your client directory.
- Supply the following credentials

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 
REACT_APP_API = http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_URL = http://localhost:3000
```

To get your Google ClientID for authentication, go to the [credential Page ](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (if you are new, then [create a new project first](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) and follow the following steps;

- Click Create credentials > OAuth client ID.
- Select the Web application type.
- Name your OAuth client and click Create
- Remember to provide your domain and redirect URL so that Google identifies the origin domain to which it can display the consent screen. In development, that is going to be `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3000/login`
- Copy the Client ID and assign it to the variable `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in your .env file

```
$ cd client
$ npm install (to install client-side dependencies)
$ npm start (to start the client)
```
In the second terminal
- cd server and create a .env file in the root of your server directory.
- Supply the following credentials

```
DB_URL = 
PORT = 5000
SECRET = 
SMTP_HOST = 
SMTP_PORT = 
SMTP_USER = 
SMTP_PASS = 

```

Please follow [This tutorial](https://dev.to/dalalrohit/how-to-connect-to-mongodb-atlas-using-node-js-k9i) to create your mongoDB connection url, which you'll use as your DB_URL

```
$ cd server
$ npm install (to install server-side dependencies)
& npm start (to start the server)
```

## Troubleshooting
If you're getting error while trying to send or download PDF,
please run the following in your server terminal.

```
$ npm install html-pdf -g
$ npm link html-pdf
$ npm link phantomjs-prebuilt
```

## Docker

Using docker is simple. Just add the .env contextualized with the docker network.

e.g:

> goes to path "server/.env"
```
DB_URL = mongodb://mongo:27017/arch
PORT = 5000
SECRET = 
SMTP_HOST = 
SMTP_PORT = 
SMTP_USER = 
SMTP_PASS = 
```
> goes to path "client/.env"
```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 
REACT_APP_API = http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_URL = http://localhost
```

And run

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

And then

docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```
